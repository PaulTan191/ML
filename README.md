# ML
Simple collection of ML projects. 

1. Final Project is a machine learning project completed for an National University of Singapore ML course: "Machine Learning for Physicists". It is a simple pedagogical project, where I investigate the structure of the periodic table.
2. Stockus.ipynb is a work in progress jupyter notebook, where I am working on predicting stock prices.
3. Stock.py contains the classes defined for use in the notebook, (Currently the classes were written in the notebook, but as the classes become more concrete, the notebook can just be a testing ground for the class.)
